# Home Price Prediction Data Analysis Project

This project aims to predict home prices in the city of Bangalore using various features and locations. The project follows a step-by-step approach, outlined below:

1. **Data Importing and DataFrame Creation:**
   The first step involves importing the data into the project and creating a structured DataFrame to work with.

2. **Handling Missing Values (NA values):**
   This step focuses on dealing with missing values in the dataset, ensuring that the data is clean and ready for analysis.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   Feature engineering is carried out to create new features or transform existing ones to improve the model's predictive performance.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction:**
   In this stage, techniques are applied to reduce the number of features while preserving the most important information, leading to better model efficiency.

5. **Outlier Removal Using Business Logic:**
   Outliers, if any, are identified and removed based on domain knowledge and business logic, ensuring the data remains reliable.

6. **Outlier Removal Using Standard Deviation:**
   Another method for outlier removal involves using statistical measures like standard deviation to identify and handle extreme data points.

7. **One-Hot Encoding:**
   Categorical variables are converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding, enabling the model to process them effectively.

8. **Using GridSearchCV for Finding the Best Model and Its Parameters:**
   GridSearchCV is employed to perform an exhaustive search over a specified parameter grid, finding the best model and its associated parameters.

9. **Model Creation:**
   In this step, a predictive model (e.g., regression, random forest, etc.) is built using the processed data to predict home prices.

10. **Exporting the Model to a Pickle File:**
   Once the model is trained and ready, it is exported and saved as a pickle file for future use or deployment.

This repository contains all the code, data, and documentation required to replicate the home price prediction analysis project for Bangalore. Feel free to explore the code and findings, and use the trained model for predicting home prices. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
